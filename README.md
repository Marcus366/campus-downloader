==================================================================

Campus-Downloader is a fastest downloader for students living in campus.

Why is Campus-Downloader fastest?
------------------------------------------------------------------
As we known, downloading speed of campus students is limited while the bandwidth
of whole campus is as many times as ours. The Campus-Downloader use broadcast to
find peer in the LAN to help download.

However, you think it sound like P2P download. Every node in P2P are equal while
Campus-Downloader are master-slave architecture. All the salve node just download
what master need and send them to master.

What are you waiting for? Just ask your school-mate run it in slave mode and you
download things in master mode. Enjoy it!
